# nai-metadata-remover
Drag-and-drop tool for removing metadata from PNG images generated by NovelAI's image generation service (also nukes regular image gen metadata). 
Drag and drop PNGs (any number of them) onto remover.exe and (with the default settings) it'll save a copy of the image scrubbed of metadata and with a generic name into the subfolder 'scrubbed'. First time you run it (or if it can't find the thing), it'll create a config.ini so you can customise its behaviour, but the defaults are:

- WILL NOT display metadata in console
- WILL remove metadata
- WILL rename image
- Exports to subfolder 'scrubbed'
- WILL NOT overwrite existing images.

If you need to reset config.ini, just delete the existing file and run remover.exe/remover.py again; even if you don't provide any images, it'll generate a fresh config.ini.

Dragging-and-dropping images works with the executable only. Source code is provided, though you'll need to install the requirements first to get it to run.
